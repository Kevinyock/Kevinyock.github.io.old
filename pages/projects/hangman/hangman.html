		The project started in July 29,2021. On July 31st, a working text base prototype was completed. This project share some of it base with the
		stat wars game. The project alos bring some design improvements such as turning multiple window classes into their own file rather than one monolithic file.
		This decision makes the code more managable as there are fewer lines of code. Progression stoped at May 22nd until August 11th, 2022.
